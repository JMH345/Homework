## The Engima Machine

![The engima machine](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-07/enigma2.jpg)

The engima machine was an encoding and decoding device used by the Nazis in World War II. Its complexity necessitated the creation of the Fletchly Park bombe by Alan Turing and his fellow code-breakers. This bombe, considered one of forerunners to modern computers, decoded the "unbreakable code" saving thousands of lives and helped turn the tide of the war for the Allies. By presenting this image, I hope to remember how modern computers can helps us achieve the ~~impossible~~.
